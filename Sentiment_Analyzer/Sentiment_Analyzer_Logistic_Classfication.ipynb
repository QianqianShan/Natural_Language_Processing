       "[\"\\n2gb of flash memory will not be destroyed at high altitude or dropped short of shattering the memory stick.  A 30gb hard drive as in the iPod 30g (that my son has) is subject to air pressure, shock and temperature domain that a flash memory device will not be subject to.  Because the hard drive spins to lift the heads above the disk, moisture from condensation will cause the head to crash if, brought in from a cold car and turned on.  I do not know about the iPod but some larger devices have dew point detector that will not spin up unless the air in the device is at safe temp.\\n\\nTHAT's WHY..\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nI purchased the Notebook Cooler approximately one month ago, after reading online testimonials of laptops becoming damaged from overheating. Thankfully, the same time I read that, Circuit City was having a sale on this item for only $15, after mail-in rebate. Fast forward one month and my opinion of the Cooler so far: not bad... \\n\\nMy laptop is noticeably cooler to the touch now, and the internal fan rarely comes on. The Notebook Cooler itself is smartly designed, with an aluminum topping and two fans that draw away heat. I\\'ll admit, the USB connector cable is a bit flimsy, and I can see why some folks have complained. For those users who travel frequently (or anyone who foresees plugging and unplugging the cable often), you may want to exercise extra caution. The blue LED light that some reviewer claims is too \"strong\" is a minor quibble--if you really wanted to, you could always tape over the light and problem solved. As for the fan noise, I would say the low setting is comparable to \"white noise,\" which you don\\'t really notice until you purposely try to listen for it! The high setting, on the other hand, is a bit loud, and I can see people having to turn up the volume on their speakers or TV to compensate. Usually, though, I only use the high setting when it\\'s really hot in the room, or if I\\'m running intensive programs like Photoshop or some video game. \\n\\nOverall, I\\'d say I\\'m very satisfied with this product. (Though, I am somewhat disappointed that Antec needs 3 months to process my $15 rebate check.) \\n']"
